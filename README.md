# Sorting-Algorithms
Sorting algorithms repository consists of algorithms that is used to sort the numerical elements of an list using c++ language. This repository includes:

* Bubble sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Selection sort
* Simple merge sort
<br/>

**1. Bubble sort :**
<br/>
Bubble sort is one of the most important and simple sorting algorithm, the working of bubble sort is nothing but it compares each of the element with its adjacent element and swaps if the right element is greater than the left element, based on your choice. As per my code file, a class named normal is created where all the variables and the member functions are created, these member functions are defined outside the class using the scope resolution operator. A function named getdata is used to create the list where all the elements are stored, once it is created the list is sent to the putdata function where the bubble sort works on the list and then the sorted list is displayed using the display function. The graphical representation of the bubble sort algorithm is as follows :

<br/>
The complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is given as:
* Time complexity :
<br/>
The best case time complexity occurs when the list is already sorted (Θ(N))
The worst case time complexity occurs when the list is reversely sorted (Θ(N^2))
<br/>
* Space complexity :
The space complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is (Θ(1))
<br/>

**2. Merge sort :**
